# Fram Fresh
Deliver organic vegetables straight to your house from our partner farmers. We can assist you in living a wonderful life, whether you are seeking simple ways to eat properly or like the challenge of cooking. Make your orders and delivery schedule your own!

## How it works

### Step 1:Pick Box
Can choose (and adjust) the size and type of produce box that works best for customer, whether they are a fruit lover, a vegan, or someone who eats everything.

### Step 2:Customize Box
Want to change the produce items that will be delivered? It's no problem! In our online Farm Stand, it's simple to add and remove things.

### Step 3:Add Products
Add distinctive hand-crafted pickles, pasture-raised eggs, dairy, artisan olive oil, small-batch honey, a 'canning case,' and more to your delivery...

### Step 4:Delivery
Change the frequency of your delivery or skip it altogether to accommodate schedule or travels

## Challenges to solve
1. Option for the user to create a profile and keep track of their subscription
2. Well crafted box to bring the best mix of 100% fresh and handcrafted farm items for the season
3. Option to view and make changes to the items in the delivery. Also, use Never Send List to omit items you don’t want.
4. Select (and edit) the size and kind of box that best suits the needs.
5. Option to miss deliveries or modify the frequency of deliveries to suit customer needs.

## Technical Choices
- CSS: We will be using Tailwind CSS for all the beautification and SCSS for whatever minimum custom requirements we need to take care of.
- State Management: Redux Toolkit so that we can take full advantage of React hooks in combination with redux
- Data Fetching: For this, we are using RTK Query as it provides a lot out of the box features for which otherwise will have to write a lot of boilerplate

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
